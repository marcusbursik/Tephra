Explanation/Definition/Example,,"name of method; include versioning of changes; a method name is helpful for production routines used for many samples, facilitates citation and re-use of the same method description; if published include DOI","first date when method was used in YYYY/MM/DD format, this helps to track versioning of methods",,"manufacturer, model (e.g. JEOL8200 with 5 spectrometers); Idea: An Interactive website/tool could help people to build a best-practice method description and could provide a reusable method code or DOI to enable re-use and citation.","name of host institution, e.g. name of university and department.

","give beam diameter in microns; note also if multiple beam diameters are used; note that this is not always provided with all instruments, such as JEOL SEMs which use a unitless “Spotsize” value that reflects both beam diameter and current.","if applicable, give beam raster dimensions in microns ","quality control reference materials (secondary standards) used. Corresponding secondary standard data should be included when reporting sample data. Best practice: Ideally this should include a material as beam sensitive or more beam sensitive than the unknowns, and it should include both high and low concentration materials (e.g. both a basalt and a hydrated rhyolite for glass analysis). Use of secondary standards that are common to multiple laboratories is also recommended to aid data comparison between labs.",Checkbox (Y/N),Checkbox (Y/N),"disregard if performing only mineral analyses; may be specific to instrument or third party software available in a lab; some can only control beam current density, analysis time, and sequence to minimize Na-diffusion; other software can track the decay and explicitly correct for it; If explicitly correcting for Na-migration, it would be useful to report the magnitude of the correction as % as this provides information about the performance of the method (e.g. conditions may be too aggressive if the correction % is frequently large) and information about sample to sample differences (e.g. more weathered / hydrated tephras will tend to have larger corrections); In some cases, corrections might also be applied to K, Si, Al; Si and Al tend to increase as beam damage progresses; K may increase, decrease, or both (behavior of alkalis can get complicated sometimes)","describe methods used to correct for instrument drift - e.g. normalization to measured beam current drift; drift correction on primary standard intensities (e.g. pre & post calibration with linear interpolation); repeated analysis of secondary standards
